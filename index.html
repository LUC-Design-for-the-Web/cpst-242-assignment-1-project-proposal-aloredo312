      </header>
      <h3>Mission Statement:</h3>
        <p>To capture the things that would otherwise only be memories take those memories and make them last forever. Let's bring your vision to life.</p>
      <h3>Goals:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Useability: I want this site easy to use and manuever to other pages.</li>
          <li>Simplicity: I like minimalism and I want this site to focus more on content like videos and photos to shine and use white space. </li>
          <li>Make us of effective words and Icons: I want to use single word phrases and icons and use them as links as well to lead users to other pages and sites.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Model Layout</h3>
        <p>I want to model my layout website from Peter Mckinnon's site. I want the home page to showcase photos and videos not too much just a few for attention grabbing. On the header I like how he has his signature on the top left and its a link to bring them back to the home page. Also the single word phrases on the top right getting to the point of what pages are on his site. His footer is basically just icons of his social media platforms, they're links that lead to them.</p>
      <a href="https://www.petermckinnon.com" target="_blank">

      </a>
      <h3>Home Page</h3>
        <p>A home page that has 3 photos maybe 1 video. It would be cool to have them as a slider effect or in the background. The header would have single word phrases that when you click them it would lead them the other pages. In the footer the social media icons will be there and those should the user to their respective sites.</p>
      <h3>Work Page</h3>
        <p>The second page would be the work page. I want this page to be the main focus that is why this page will have photos and videos showing. I'm thinking they can be broken down into 4-5 sections or categories or maybe just have them mixed together.</p>
      <h3>About Page</h3>
        <p>The third page is an about page and it's going to have two purposes. This page will focus more on a profile so that the user gets to know the photographer. It will consist of a brief summary and either a self portrait or three photos.</p>
      <h3>Contact Page</h3>
        <p>The last one is to have a contact page, this one is self explanatory. This page will have a photo maybe the self portrait can go here and right next to it a form to fill out information. At the bottom of this page it will have the social media icons with links to those sites.</p>
      <h3>Target Audience</h3>
        <p>The target audience for this site is for those who are interested in photography, filmmaking, or are content creators. It is for a user who is looking for examples of work. If somebody is interested in getting their photo taken or if they have products they want photos taken of, I will have four styles of photography in the site. I will make sure to  also have video work examples, maybe they will be more interested in short videos, documentary, or just simply the service of video editing. It can also be for those who are interested in collaboration, it can be another  place to reach out.</p>
